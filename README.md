# Online Resume Project 
Using jQuery, developed an interactive resume application that reads all data from a JSON file and then dynamically modifies the DOM to display the information. Further customized the project by personalizing the design using CSS. My
code is most of the code in `css/style.css`, some of the code in `js/helper.js`, and all of the code in `js/resumeBuilder.js`.
